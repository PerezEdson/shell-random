## Dead

I don't know why I have a bash subdirectory over here.  It looks like everything here has been integrated into a live subtree but I'll keep it all here just in case.



## WARNING

Do not run any of these scripts directly!

They don't work like regular scripts.

They are designed to be sourced by bash when it first starts up.
