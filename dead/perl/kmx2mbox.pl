#
# Changelog:
# version 1.5 12/09/2002: added the news beta .mwx mailbox format
#                         this format is very simple, almost mbox
#                         add too a check for bogus "from" email 
#                         used by some broke emails (read: spam)
# version 1.2 29/06/2002: tweaked a little to make better mbox format...
#                          this should allow a direct use of the mbox in
#                          eudora
# version 1.1  1/12/2001: add support for ancient MW mailboxes but already 
#                          converted to kmx mailboxes, i can find and fix the
#                          from and subject, i have no idea where MW goes get
#                          the date from this headerless emails, it will use
#                          the last date found or 1/1/1998 if none found
# version 1.0c 5/11/2001: initial release

#
# this little perl script translates the uncompressed kmx mailboxes from 
# the great email client for window$, Kaufman Mail Warrior 3.61, to the 
# standard unix mbox.
# Most emails clients can read/import this files.
#
# i made this because the MW was the only thing that force me to boot
# to window$ to read my new email and find old emails in my big mailboxes
# (fgrep and fetchmail/others could do this was not "easy" and practical)
# MW cant work in wine and don't have any export email option and i didn't
# want to have some emails in windows and others in Linux
# with this i can get the email i get from window$ to Linux and use
# the Linux as my main OS and window$ just for some games
# Kaufman already said that he will make a Linux version of MW too, but 
# until it show up this is a easy way to share the MW emails with Linux
#
# kmx2mbox (name) read the kmx file with that name and writes one mailbox
# file to the same dir with the name name.mbox without the .kmx
# is up to the user to move and rename the mbox files to use then
# ex: kmx2mbox Inbox.kmx  will save the file to Inbox.mbox to the same dir
#
#
# To use just make sure the the MW mailbox are uncompressed
# (ie: you didn't ever used the compact command in MW)
# if they are compressed, create a new mailbox and copy the emails
# to that new mailbox and this time don't compact it.   8)
# Then in Linux, copy the kmx files to a dir, place the kmx2mbox in that dir
# or put it on the path, go to that kmx dir  and run:
#
#   for file in *.kmx; do kmx2mbox "$file"; done
#
# this will convert all the kmx files on the directory
#
# this is what the main idea from the script:
# -search  ^(?^@^@^@) -1 random character + 3 null characters at the start 
#  of the line (i call this the start message code)
# -ignore until the ++first++ *(!MW36_xMailBoundary)* is found (must ignore 
#  this line too...this is the start email code )
# -Save the email until the next ^(?^@^@^@) is found
# -start over again
# of course there is small problems (codes), but i think i manage then all
#
# Known Bugs:
# -REALLY wierd spam/virus emails may confuse the script and most probably
#  will finish inside other, more normal email... not a big deal, at least
#  for me. in my many emails, i only found ONE wierd email like this
# -it doesn't check to see if the name.mbox already exists
# -cant rebuild the attach files (hey, search the attach folder, you have 
#  the names at the end of each email
# -cant work with compressed kmx
# -i think this work only for MW 3.6x mailboxes (not sure)
# -don't know if i got all the possible "start message" codes, if you get
#  any email inside others, check this to see what i have missed...
#  for now it check for ?^@, ?^A to ?^E and ^^A 
#   (maybe it's fixed, found a safer/better way)
#
# i wrote many comments, this script should be easy to understand (i hope)
#
#	Good luck and enjoy
